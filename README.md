# Diwali Sales Analysis using Python

## Overview
The **Diwali Sales Analysis** project leverages Python to analyze and visualize sales data related to the Diwali festival. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical modeling to uncover insights and trends in sales performance.

## Technologies and Tools
1. **Data Processing with Pandas**: 
   - Pandas is used for data cleaning, manipulation, and preprocessing. Key operations include handling missing values, transforming data, and aggregating sales data by different time periods.

2. **Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn**: 
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed to create visualizations such as sales trends over time, seasonal patterns, and comparisons between different categories. These visualizations help in understanding sales dynamics and presenting findings effectively.

3. **Statistical Analysis and Modeling**: 
   - Statistical techniques and machine learning models are used to analyze sales data, predict future sales, and evaluate factors affecting sales performance. This includes time series analysis, regression models, and seasonal decomposition.
